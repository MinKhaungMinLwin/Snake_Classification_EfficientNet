## Snake Detection
This Snake detection classifier was build with Convolutional Neural Network and using computer vision to detect various kind of snake.

model architecture
    1. Collect Dataset
    2. Data preprocessing for input data and output data
    3. Build Convolutional Neural Network
    4. Train the network with optimizer and cost function
    5. Save the model with checkpoint using early stopping.
    6. Use the pretrained model to make detection
    7. Create local host server with flask and input model to detect from it
